#   JCF, Sep-7-2017

#   This sourcefile needs to be sourced before running DAQInterface. 

#   Consequences of sourcing are:
#
#   * An alias is created so the command "DAQInterface" will run DAQInterface
#
#   * The output of a DAQInterface session will be saved in a logfile
#     referred to by $DAQINTERFACE_LOGFILE
#
#   * An optional, user-defined sourcefile referred to by
#     $DAQINTERFACE_USER_SOURCEFILE will also be sourced - see below
#     under "Requirements" for more on this

#   Requirements to be met before the sourcing are:
#
#   * DAQInterface needs to have been successfully set up as a ups product
#
#   * The sourcefile has not yet been sourced successfully in the
#     environment
#
#   * If you want the sourcefile to, in turn, source a user-defined
#     sourcefile, the user-defined sourcefile name needs be referred to
#     by the environment variable $DAQINTERFACE_USER_SOURCEFILE. The
#     user-defined sourcefile must actually be owned by the active user
#     in the environment ($USER), and within its body it must export an
#     environment variable called "DAQINTERFACE_USER_SOURCEFILE_ERRNO"
#     and set it to 0 to let this "parent" sourcefile know that the user
#     sourcefile was sourced correctly. If you do not wish for a
#     user-defined sourcefile to be sourced, you must set
#     DAQINTERFACE_USER_SOURCEFILE to IGNORED. Not setting
#     DAQINTERFACE_USER_SOURCEFILE is treated as an error.
