Sample configuration: combined_eb_and_dl
18-Apr-2018, KAB

Please Note:  this configuration is not yet operational since ther
are DAQInterface changes that need to be made to support it.

To-do: rename Aggregator files as DataLogger and Dispatcher files.

Description:
This configuration is intended to demonstrate/test the use of a system that
combines the EventBuilding and DataLogger layers into one.
Its parentage includes the multiple_dataloggers, config_includes, and demo
configurations.  As of 18-Apr-2018, its observable output should
be very similar to the basic demo, modulo the splitting of the data into 4 files
on disk, the note below about only sending events from one DL to the Dispatcher,
and the change of the RootOutput compression level from 3 to 0.

Some notes:
* This configuration needs an enhanced copy of the typical boot.txt file, and a
  sample is included with this configuration.  To use this file, you should first
  edit it to replace <yourArtdaqInstallationDir> with the correct path. Then,
  to run this demo, you can use the following commands:
  - 'cd <yourArtdaqDemoInstallationDir>'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config combined_eb_and_dl --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/combined_eb_and_dl/boot.txt'
  - or 
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config combined_eb_and_dl --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/combined_eb_and_dl/boot.txt --comps component01 component02 component03 --'

* When using earlier versions of art, only one DataLogger can effectively send
  events to the Dispatcher. Of course, it is possible to configure a system to do
  otherwise, and such a system will run, but only one of the N events sent to the
  Dispatcher will be de-serializable. This is because the different DataLogger
  configurations (different RootOutput filenames) will violate the requirement
  that upstream art configurations must be identical in order for downstream
  processes to understand them.
  It was hoped that this restriction would be removed in art v2.08+, but that
  does not appear to be the case.  Given that, the configurations for DataLoggers
  2, 3, and 4 in this configuration have the rootNetOutput lines (two per file)
  commented out.  To run a test in which all four DLs send events to the Dispatcher,
  edit DataLogger2/3/4.fcl to restore the rootNetOutput lines.
