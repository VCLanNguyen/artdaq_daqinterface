Sample configuration: multiple_dataloggers
18-Apr-2018, KAB

Description:
This configuration is intended to demonstrate/test the use of multiple DataLoggers.
Its parent is the "config_includes" sample (which is intended to demonstrate a
possible reorganization of the FHiCL configuration files), and its grandparent is
the basic "demo" configuration.  As of 18-Apr-2018, its observable output should
be very similar to the basic demo, modulo the splitting of the data into 4 files
on disk and the note below about only sending events from one DL to the Dispatcher.

Some notes:
* This configuration needs an enhanced copy of the typical boot.txt file, and a
  sample is included with this configuration.  To use this file, you should first
  edit it to replace <yourArtdaqInstallationDir> with the correct path. Then,
  to run this demo, you can use the following commands:
  - 'cd <yourArtdaqDemoInstallationDir>'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config multiple_dataloggers --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/multiple_dataloggers/boot.txt'

* When using earlier versions of art, only one DataLogger can effectively send
  events to the Dispatcher. Of course, it is possible to configure a system to do
  otherwise, and that will work, but only one of the N events sent to the Dispatcher
  will be de-serializable
  This is because the DataLogger configurations will not be identical (they
  will have different RootOutput filenames), and we will violate the requirement
  that upstream art configurations must be identical in order for downstream
  processes to understand them.
  It is possible that this restriction is removed in art v2.08+, and we will test
  that soon.
