Sample configuration: request_based_dataflow_example
Notes on 03-May-2018, KAB (created by ELF and others)

Description:
This configuration is intended to demonstrate/test the use of a system that
receives data in push mode from one BoardReader and pulls data from two others.

Some notes:
* This configuration benefits from enhanced copy of the typical boot.txt file, and a
  sample is included with this configuration.  To use this file, you should first
  edit it to replace <yourArtdaqInstallationDir> with the correct path. Then,
  to run this demo, you can use the following commands:
  - 'cd <yourArtdaqDemoInstallationDir>'
  - 'sh ./run_demo.sh --config request_based_dataflow_example --bootfile `pwd`/artdaq-utilities-daqinterface/simple_test_config/request_based_dataflow_example/boot.txt --comps component01 component02 component03 --'

* NOTE that the pull-mode data requests that are used in this sample make use of 
  multicast Ethernet messages.  As such, there may
  be firewall settings that need to be tuned.  Please see the text that describes
  this in ../README.simple_test_configs.

* It is useful to watch data fragments going into the CommandableFragmentGenerator
  data buffer and being pulled out and sent to the EBs.  The following TRACE
  commands can help configure the system to provide that information:
